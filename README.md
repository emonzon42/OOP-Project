# OOP-Project

This was my object-oriented programming assignment for my Principles of Programming Languages class (ICSI 311)

I created a game that is suppose to mimic buying and selling goods for customers and businesses and I made a 
library that mimics a banking system that is used by the game. I tried making the library as portable as possible
to further show it is used by the game but is not a part of the game itself. 


The game starts the player off with a randomly decided amount of money and the option to either sell the goods they
started off with, or buy more goods to fill their inventory and sell afterwards. The player also starts off with a 
credit limit and credit score which they can raise to use to buy products on credit. When selling goods the player is 
given an offer by a random company, which they can then either accept, decline, or attempt to raise. If the company
gives an offer that isn't ideal the player can negotiate a higher offer in which the company will either accept or
present another offer. When buying goods, the player is given a list of items to purchase from, in which the player
can either pay for in debit, credit, or cash. 


This wasn't intended as a full-scale game, and started with me making the banking library then adding on the interactive
aspect afterwards. This was designed, created, and finished within a one-week deadline to show my "mastery" in OOP
concepts.
